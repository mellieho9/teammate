#  Teammate
An app that facilitates making friends with people who can help you move forward

## Background 💡

State universities tend to be very large. In-state students go in already having an established network with their friends from childhood and high school, who can introduce them to their other friends. Out-of-state and international students have a much harder time as they come in without any existing network. Teammate removes a need for an established connection and help people make friends that can help them move forward. In the larger scheme of things, Teammate also helps foster a more collaborative university environment by connecting users with people sharing their academic and personal interests.


## Current progress  🏃
- [x] Connect with Firebase for login authentication/create an account
- [x] Create components and views for all intended features (login/register, entering user information, user profile matching, chat, inbox, user profile)
- [ ] Create the ranking algorithm to rank users' profile based on % of classes/interests/clubs they share with the current users (Ongoing)
- [ ] Use Firebase to load message history (Ongoing)
- [ ] Link all views together (Ongoing, just having trouble directing user to matched view after user swiped right on a profile whose user also swiped right on their profile)

## What's next  🧩
- Expand Teammate to users of other institutions
- Implement features to directly book study rooms from the app, schedule meetings, and alert public authorities when date went wrong
